# Content-Strategy-and-Communication

## Strategic Documentation and Knowledge Management Specialist
This repository showcases the process and application of some of my work creating and scaling standardized content systems within complex, global organizations, smaller businesses, and solo-preneurs over the past 20 years (2005-2025). <br><br>

### Summary
I decode problems and provide solutions, make complex things clearer and easier to absorb, and know how to reach an international audience. I can do this for both small and big corporate structures, though am especially good with organisations that are growing quickly and need help keeping all the balls in the air for the most homogenous and efficient growth. 
<br><br>
I do this through a mix of experience, intuition, best practices and strategic guidance, and am very Agile and user-centric minded.
<br><br>
Over the years, I have worked with hundreds of systems, tools, platforms, and programs and pick up new technology quickly. I'm also multilingual and very comfortable with AI.

### Public Writing Sample
For a direct example of my writing style and ability to articulate technical concepts into everyday language and analogies, please see my blog: <br><br>
**Two Unicorns and a Chameleon** <br>
In my little world on WordPress, I think out loud about why we do what we do in business, technology, and daily life in blogs that are short enough for a quick coffee break yet long enough to make you think. <br><br>
For those interested in my writing skills, it provides insight into my voice, vibe, and ability to bring clarity to complexity. The link opens an overview by category. <br><br> Let me know you´ve stopped by! <br><br>
